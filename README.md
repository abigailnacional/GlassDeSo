# GlassDeSo
Code for the GlassDeSo project for MLH's Power Up hackathon.

### Acknowledgements
Identity login code and basic setup for the Flask app come from [Bitclout Python Login/Identity Example](https://github.com/neonstoic/BitcloutPythonIdentityExample).

Several API calls are based off of [DeSoApiLesson1](https://replit.com/@kennyjacobson/DeSoApiLesson1) and [DeSoApiLesson2](https://replit.com/@kennyjacobson/DeSoApiLesson2).
